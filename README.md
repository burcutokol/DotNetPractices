# Book Store Project

This project contains a web API developed for a bookstore application. 
The API manages basic operations related to books, authors, and book genres. 
These operations include listing books, viewing their details, adding new books, updating existing books, and deleting books. 
Similar operations are also supported for authors and genres. 
The project incorporates FluentValidation for validating input data, utilizes unit tests (IClassFixture), performs object mapping with AutoMapper (IMapper), handles common business logic and operations through middleware, and manages error logs with a logger.
